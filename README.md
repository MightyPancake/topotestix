# TopoTestix

Environment-aware property-based testing framework for distributed systems, built on Nix and NixOS.

Instead of testing only application-level inputs, TopoTestix treats **system configuration as a first-class test dimension**. A fuzzer generates diverse NixOS VM configurations (network topology, resource limits, service versions) from a single seed, runs them as NixOS integration tests, and on failure shrinks the seed to find a minimal reproducing case.
