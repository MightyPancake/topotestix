### Key Insight: Topology Is Just Multi-Node Config

In NixOS VM tests, there is no separate "topology" layer. Everything is node config:

| Topology concept | NixOS mechanism |
|---|---|
| Node count | Number of attribute sets in `nodes` |
| Network connectivity | `virtualisation.vlans` per node (list — node can be on multiple VLANs) |
| Network partitions | Nodes on different VLANs |
| Shared communication | Nodes on a common VLAN |
| Latency / packet loss | `tc` config or systemd service per node |
| Node roles | Different service configs per node |

VLANs are the only primitive needed. Nodes on the same VLAN can communicate; nodes on different VLANs cannot. A node can be on multiple VLANs (e.g., `[1 10]`), enabling mixed topologies — isolated role networks plus a shared communication VLAN.

### Three-Layer Config Composition

Each node's final config is built from three independent layers, merged by the orchestrator:

```
base config  ⊕  fuzzed target configs  ⊕  fuzzed topology configs  =  final node config
(stable)       (per-role, from fuzzer)   (per-node, from fuzzer + expandTopology)
```

| Layer | Source | Example options | Applied to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Base config** | User-provided | `environment.systemPackages`, `services.kafka.enable` | All nodes identically |
| **Fuzzed target configs** | Fuzzer (per-role call) | `virtualisation.memorySize`, `services.openssh.enable` | Nodes of the same role share one fuzzer call |
| **Fuzzed topology configs** | Fuzzer (topology call) + expandTopology | `virtualisation.vlans`, role-specific configs | Per-node, derived from topology-map |

```nix
# Base config (same for all nodes)
baseConfig = { services.openssh.enable = true; environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.vim ]; };

# Fuzzed target config (one fuzzer call per role)
brokerConfig     = (fuzzer { seed = "43"; target = configSpec; }).result;
controllerConfig = (fuzzer { seed = "44"; target = configSpec; }).result;

# Fuzzed topology config (one fuzzer call → topology-map, then expandTopology)
topology-map = (fuzzer { seed = "42"; target = topologySpec; }).result;
# => { brokerVlans = [1 10]; controllerVlans = [2 10]; roles = { broker = 2; controller = 1; }; }

topologyConfigs = expandTopology { inherit topology-map; };
# => { broker1.vlans = [1 10]; broker2.vlans = [1 10]; controller1.vlans = [2 10]; }

# Final composition (orchestrator merges all three per node)
finalConfigs.broker1     = recursiveUpdate (recursiveUpdate baseConfig brokerConfig)     topologyConfigs.broker1;
finalConfigs.broker2     = recursiveUpdate (recursiveUpdate baseConfig brokerConfig)     topologyConfigs.broker2;
finalConfigs.controller1 = recursiveUpdate (recursiveUpdate baseConfig controllerConfig) topologyConfigs.controller1;
```

## Module Details

### Fuzzer

Pure function: `seed + target → { result, choices }`. No cluster awareness, no node naming, no topology logic.

#### Mechanism

Seed → deterministic hash → choice per option. Same seed always produces the same config.

The fuzzer is called multiple times by the orchestrator — once for topology, once per role for config — each with a derived seed.

**Input:**
- `seed` — integer
- `target` — Nix attribute set describing fuzzable dimensions

**Output:**
- `result`: flat attribute set of resolved values
- `choices`: target-relative path map such as `{ ".virtualisation.memorySize" = 2; }`

```nix
fuzzer {
  seed = 43;
  target = {
    virtualisation.memorySize = [ 512 1024 2048 4096 ];
    services.openssh.enable = [ true false ];
  };
}
# => { result = { virtualisation.memorySize = 2048; services.openssh.enable = false; };
#      choices = { ".virtualisation.memorySize" = 2; ".services.openssh.enable" = 0; }; }
```

```nix
fuzzer {
  seed = 42;
  target = {
    roles.broker = [ 1 2 3 ];
    roles.controller = [ 1 ];
    brokerVlans = [ [1] [1 10] ];
    controllerVlans = [ [2] [2 10] ];
  };
}
# => { result = { roles.broker = 2; roles.controller = 1;
#      brokerVlans = [1 10]; controllerVlans = [2 10]; };
#      choices = { ".roles.broker" = 1; ...; }; }
```

Note: both calls use the same mechanism. The fuzzer doesn't know or care whether it's resolving topology or config — it just picks values from lists based on a seed.

#### Combinators

Shared combinator language:

```nix
{
  bool      = [ false true ];
  range     = min: max: step: [ min ... max ];
  oneOf     = options: options;
}
```

Inter-field dependent combinators are future work and are not implemented in the current library.

#### Shrinking

- **Choice-based shrinking** — reduces choice indices toward 0 (not seed-based)
- **Target config domain:** simpler values (lower memory, fewer services enabled, fewer packages)
- **Topology domain:** fewer nodes, simpler VLAN sets, no partitions
- The fuzzer returns `{ result, choices }` — `choices` maps paths to indices for shrinking
- The shrinker module (`lib/shrinker.nix`) applies index overrides to fuzzed output, producing simpler configs
- Python orchestrator drives the iterative shrinking loop; Nix evaluates each candidate
- **Convention:** lower index = simpler value in target spec option lists (including `bool = [false true]`)

See [shrinking.md](shrinking.md) for full design.

---

### expandTopology

Pure deterministic function: `topology-map → per-node VLAN configs`. No seed, no randomness.

Takes the flat output of a topology fuzzer call and mechanically expands it into per-node attribute sets.

**Input:**
- `topology-map` — flat attribute set from topology fuzzer call (roles and VLAN sets per role)

**Output:**
- Per-node attribute set with `virtualisation.vlans` assignments

```nix
expandTopology {
  topology-map = {
    roles = { broker = 2; controller = 1; };
    brokerVlans = [1 10];
    controllerVlans = [2 10];
  };
}
# => {
#   broker1     = { virtualisation.vlans = [1 10]; };
#   broker2     = { virtualisation.vlans = [1 10]; };
#   controller1 = { virtualisation.vlans = [2 10]; };
# }
```

The expansion is deterministic: "2 brokers with VLANs `[1 10]`, 1 controller with VLANs `[2 10]`" → name nodes `broker1`, `broker2`, `controller1` and assign each their role's VLAN set.

#### VLAN Membership Model

VLANs are per-node lists. A node can be on multiple VLANs:

| VLAN setup | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `virtualisation.vlans = [1];` | Node on VLAN 1 only |
| `virtualisation.vlans = [2];` | Node on VLAN 2 only, cannot reach VLAN 1 nodes |
| `virtualisation.vlans = [1 10];` | Node on VLAN 1 (role network) and VLAN 10 (shared communication) |
| `virtualisation.vlans = [2 10];` | Node on VLAN 2 (role network) and VLAN 10 (shared communication) |

The last two create a mixed topology: brokers and controllers are isolated on their own VLANs but can communicate through the shared VLAN 10. Removing VLAN 10 creates a partition.

The target spec author defines which VLAN set combinations are valid for the SUT. The fuzzer just picks from these lists.

---

### Merge

Pure deterministic function for three-layer config composition. See [merge.md](merge.md) for full design.

**`mkForceAttrs`**: Recursively applies `lib.mkForce` to all leaf values. Used on fuzzed config and topology layers so they override base values.

**`mergeConfigs`**: `base ⊕ config ⊕ topology`. Base is plain, config and topology are mkForce'd before merging. Topology wins over config on conflicts. Both config and topology use mkForce (priority 50) — on key conflicts, topology wins by position (last `recursiveUpdate`), not by priority. In practice config and topology fuzz different dimensions (services/resources vs network/VLAN), so conflicts should not arise. See [merge.md](merge.md) for details.

Same pattern as `expandTopology` — pure function, no seed, no randomness. Called by the orchestrator (or in flake.nix), not by the runner.

---

### Runner

Based on NixOS `testers.runNixOSTest`. Thin wrapper that composes inputs into a runnable test, injects property helpers, and produces structured reports. See [runner.md](runner.md) for full design.

**Inputs:** `nodeConfigs`, `testScript`, `properties`, `name`, `reportNode`

**Output:** `report.json` (structured test results via `copy_from_machine`), test derivation pass/fail

Property checks are currently auto-appended after the user test script. The `_check()` function catches all exceptions and does not re-raise, so all properties are always evaluated even after failures. Explicit checkpoints are future work.

---

### Orchestrator

Python CLI application in the `topotestix` package. Central coordinator — other modules interact through it.

**Seed derivation:** The orchestrator derives all seeds from a single `master_seed`:
- `master_seed + 0` → topology fuzzer call
- `master_seed + 1 + roleIndex` → per-role config fuzzer call, with role names sorted alphabetically

This ensures reproducibility from a single seed and makes shrinking straightforward — change the master seed, and everything changes deterministically.

**Responsibilities:**
1. Accept user input (testScript, base config, config target spec, topology target spec)
2. Derive topology and per-role seeds from master_seed
3. Call fuzzer for topology → topology-map
4. Call expandTopology(topology-map) → per-node VLAN configs
5. Call fuzzer once per role → per-role config
6. Three-layer merge: `base ⊕ per-role config ⊕ per-node topology config`
7. Call runner with composed final node configs
8. Parse report.json / stdout from runner
9. On failure: shrink choice indices and iterate (see [shrinking.md](shrinking.md))
10. Persist run metadata, logs, and reports under `.topotestix/runs`
11. Output summary of all runs and minimal failing cases

**Shrinking loop (conceptual):**

```
for seed in seeds:
    result = run(seed)
    if result.failed:
        for choice_path in shrinkable_paths:
            for simpler_index in range(current_index - 1, -1, -1):
                result = run_with_override(seed, choice_path, simpler_index)
                if result.failed:
                    keep override (simpler value still triggers bug)
                    break
```

Each choice is shrunk independently: topology choices first, then per-role config choices. The shrinker operates on choice indices, not seeds — see [shrinking.md](shrinking.md).

**Future (not priority):** speculative parallel shrinking (the greedy shrinking loop stays sequential). Parallel seed execution is implemented via `sweep --jobs N` — see [orchestrator.md](orchestrator.md). Note each seed builds a NixOS test that boots QEMU VM(s); `jobs × nodes-per-cluster` VMs may run at once, so tune `--jobs` to host RAM and Nix `max-jobs`. Per-run `elapsed` (monotonic) and sweep `totalTime`/`avgRunTime` are reported; under parallelism `sum(elapsed)` may exceed `totalTime` (overlapping runs), while `avgRunTime` is the mean per-run duration.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Orchestrator is central** — other modules interact through it, not with each other
2. **Fuzzer is pure: seed + target → { result, choices }** — no cluster logic, no node naming, no awareness of how many times it's called
3. **expandTopology is a separate pure function** — deterministic expansion, no seed, no randomness
4. **Three-layer config composition** — base config ⊕ fuzzed target configs ⊕ fuzzed topology configs = final node config, merged via `lib.recursiveUpdate`
5. **Topology outputs per-node attribute sets** — VLANs, roles are NixOS options merged like any other config layer
6. **VLAN membership is per-node lists** — enables mixed topologies (shared + isolated VLANs), partitions, and network variations
7. **Seed-as-key** — all seeds derived from master_seed. Reproducibility from one number. Shrinking operates on choice indices, not seeds (see [shrinking.md](shrinking.md)).
8. **Properties are Python helpers defined in Nix** — reusable across SUTs, injected into testScript by runner, and currently auto-appended after the user script
9. **Fuzzer outputs only fuzzed options** — base config is added by orchestrator, keeping the fuzzer's responsibility minimal
10. **Every module usable from CLI** — fuzzer, targets, runs, runner, and orchestrator are exposed under `topotestix`
11. **Lazy evaluation leveraged** — runner imports fuzzer via Nix, so only evaluated configs are built
